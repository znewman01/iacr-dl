<b>Impossibility  Results  for  Universal  Composability  in  Public-Key  Models   and  with  Fixed  Inputs</b><p />
<i>Dafna  Kidron   and  Yehuda  Lindell</i><p />
<b>Abstract: </b>Universal  composability   and  concurrent  general  composition  consider  a  setting  where  secure  protocols  are  run  concurrently  with  each  other   and  with  arbitrary  other  possibly  insecure  protocols.  Protocols  that  meet  the  definition  of  universal  composability  are  guaranteed  to  remain  secure  even  when  run  in  this  strongly  adversarial  setting.  In  the  case  of  an  honest  majority,  or  where  there  is  a  trusted  setup  phase  of  some  kind (like  a  common  reference  string  or  the  key-registration  public-key  infrastructure  of  Barak  et  al.~in  FOCS 2004),  it  has  been  shown  that  any  functionality  can  be  securely  computed  in  a  universally  composable  way.  On  the  negative  side,  it  has  also  been  shown  that  in  the {\em  plain  model}\/  where  there  is  no  trusted  setup  at  all,  there  are  large  classes  of  functionalities  which  cannot  be  securely  computed  in  a  universally  composable  way  without  an  honest  majority.
<P>
In  this  paper  we  extend  these  impossibility  results  for  universal  composability.  We  study  a  number  of  public-key  models   and  show  for  which  models  the  impossibility  results  of  universal  composability  hold   and  for  which  they  do  not.  We  also  consider   a  setting  where  the  inputs  to  the  protocols  running  in  the  network  are  fixed  before  any  execution  begins.  The  majority  of  our  results  are  negative   and  we  show  that  the  known  impossibility  results  for  universal  composability  in  the  case  of  no  honest  majority  extend  to  many  other  settings.
