<b>Finding  a  Nash  Equilibrium  Is  No  Easier  Than  Breaking  Fiat-Shamir</b><p />

<b>Abstract: </b>The  Fiat-Shamir  heuristic  transforms  a  public-coin  interactive  proof  into  a  non-interactive  argument,  by  replacing  the  verifier  with  a  cryptographic  hash  function  that  is  applied  to  the  protocolâ€™s  transcript.  Constructing  hash  functions  for  which  this  transformation  is  sound  is  a  central   and  long-standing  open  question  in  cryptography.
<P>
We  show  that  solving  the  End-of-Metered-Line  problem  is  no  easier  than  breaking  the  soundness  of  the  Fiat-Shamir  transformation  when  applied  to  the  sumcheck  protocol.  In  particular,  if  the  transformed  protocol  is  sound,  then  any  hard  problem  in #P  gives  rise  to  a  hard  distribution  in  the  class  CLS,  which  is  contained  in  PPAD.
<P>
Our  main  technical  contribution  is  a  stateful  incrementally  verifiable  procedure  that,  given  a  SAT  instance  over  n  variables,  counts  the  number  of  satisfying  assignments.  This  is  accomplished  via  an  exponential  sequence  of  small  steps,  each  computable  in  time  poly(n).  Incremental  verifiability  means  that  each  intermediate  state  includes  a  sumcheck-based  proof  of  its  correctness,   and  the  proof  can  be  updated   and  verified  in  time  poly(n).
<P>
Combining  our  construction  with  a  hash  family  proposed  by  Canetti  et  al.  [STOC 2019]  gives  rise  to  a  distribution  in  the  class  CLS,  which  is  provably  hard  under  the  assumption  that  any  one  of  a  class  of  fully  homomorphic  encryption (FHE)  schemes  has  almost-optimal  security  against  quasi-polynomial  time  adversaries,   and  under  the  additional  worst-case  assumption  that  there  is  no  polynomial  time  algorithm  for  counting  the  number  of  satisfying  assignments  for  formulas  over  a  polylogarithmic  number  of  variables.
